This is my Diploma Project for Master Degree of Computer Science in University of Lodz. The topic of diploma project - Web application in form of bookstore/library. 
I'm gonna use Spring as a backend part, PostgreSQL as a database and React as a frontend. Possible changes in stack are expected in future!
